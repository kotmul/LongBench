While the profile changes of influential leads are mostly profile image and profile description, the profile changes of their followers are mostly profile username and profile description. This suggests that the profile changes of influential leads are more about maintaining their online presence and image, while the profile changes of their followers are more about adapting to the social movement.", "answers": ["Influential leaders are more likely to change their profile attributes than their followers; the leaders do not change their usernames, while their followers change their usernames a lot; the leaders  tend to make new changes related to previous attribute values, while the followers make comparatively less related changes to previous attribute values."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5092}

Knowledge coverage: This measures the percentage of facts that are covered by the KBOWC model. A higher knowledge coverage indicates that the model has learned a more complete knowledge base.\n\n2. Knowledge learning: This measures the percentage of facts that are learned by the KBOWC model during training. A higher knowledge learning indicates that the model is able to efficiently learn new knowledge.\n\n3.

It proposes a neural model that can identify argument components and relations between them. The model is evaluated on a dataset of user comments from news articles, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. The paper claims that the model can identify various types of argumentation structures, including counter-arguments, rebuttals, and premises. However, the paper does not explicitly state which specific argumentation phenomena are accounted for by the model. It would be helpful to clarify which types of argumentation structures are identified by the model and how they are represented.", "answers": ["Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 14471}
