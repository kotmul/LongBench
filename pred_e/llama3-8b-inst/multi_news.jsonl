It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

However, the focus has shifted from simply showing girls what an office looks like to encouraging them to become leaders. The current reality is that women hold only 3.6% of CEO positions, 14% of executive officer roles, and 16% of board director positions in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nTo address this disparity, it's time to take daughters to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work. This requires more than just a single day of exposure; it demands proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. Companies and schools must provide opportunities for girls to interact with successful women, understand the daily responsibilities and rewards of leadership, and receive sponsorship and support.\n\nThe Girl Scouts' recent study found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity. Introducing girls to female role models, such as CEOs and executive officers, can make a significant difference. Companies can also provide clear explanations of what leaders do, highlighting their accomplishments and providing opportunities for girls to see them in action.\n\nThe Princeton University example demonstrates the impact of proactive efforts. By encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, the university increased the number of female Rhodes Scholars. Similarly, companies can implement sponsorship initiatives to identify and groom female talent.\n\nThe lack of women in leadership positions is not only a corporate issue but also a societal one, affecting the country's competitiveness and undermining ideals of fairness and social equality.

Despite the lack of significant progress on key issues, both leaders expressed optimism about the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was seen as a win for Putin, who was able to set the tone and format of the discussion. The Russian leader was accompanied only by his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and two translators, ensuring that there were no leaks or sensitive information shared. Trump, on the other hand, was accompanied by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.\n\nThe two leaders discussed a range of issues, including Russia's election hacking, Syria, and Ukraine. While Trump did not directly accuse Russia of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, he did say that \"it was probably other people and/or countries\" involved. Putin, meanwhile, denied any Russian involvement and claimed that Trump had accepted his denials.\n\nThe meeting was also marked by a lack of transparency, with the White House declining to provide details on what Trump would request of Putin and what he might offer in exchange for cooperation. Tillerson said that Trump wanted to discuss ways to stabilize war-ravaged Syria, including the possibility of establishing joint mechanisms for ensuring stability.\n\nThe summit comes amid ongoing investigations into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and concerns about Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine.

Despite efforts by Chinese diplomats to help him return to China, Wang Qi was denied official documents and citizenship, and was not allowed to leave India.\n\nWang Qi's story is a long and sad one. He was born to a farmer family in Shaanxi and joined China's People's Liberation Army in 1960. He was tasked with building roads for the Chinese army and was captured when he strayed into India's territory. He spent years in jail, was denied official documents, and was forced to adapt to a new life in India. He married a local woman, Sushila, and had three children and grandchildren.\n\nIn recent years, Wang Qi's family has been working to help him return to China. His nephew helped him obtain a Chinese passport in 2013, and Chinese diplomats have been making efforts to help him return. Last week, Wang Qi finally returned to China, accompanied by his adult children. He was met by family members and crowds in Beijing, and later in his home city of Xianyang, where he was greeted with banners reading \"Welcome home, soldier, it's been a rough journey\".\n\nWang Qi's return has sparked a mixed reaction in India and China. Some Indians have praised the government for allowing him to return, while others have criticized the delay. In China, Wang Qi's return has been widely celebrated, with many expressing sympathy for his suffering over the years. Wang Qi himself is eager to taste noodles, a local specialty in Shaanxi, and is looking forward to reuniting with his family.", "answers": ["In 1963, a 23-year-old surveyor for the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army accidentally crossed the border into India.

He told the BBC in a previous interview that he got lost and was \"tired and hungry.\" He found a Red Cross vehicle and asked for help, only to be turned over to the Indian army. After nearly seven years in various jails, authorities relocated Wang to a remote village, the Hindustan Times reports. He was not allowed to return to China, however, but nor was he given Indian citizenship. He lived in a kind of limbo. \"I cried in the night,\" Wang says of those first years in India. \"I missed my mother.\" He eventually married, worked at a flour mill, and had children and grandchildren, but he never stopped hoping to return home. A spokesperson for the Chinese government blames Indian bureaucracy for preventing Wang's return over the past half-century. But after being visited by a delegation from the Chinese embassy in recent weeks, visas were procured for Wang and his relatives. His wife was too sick to travel, but Wang arrived in Beijing on Friday with his adult children, where they were met by his surviving relatives.

{"pred": "\n\nThe Pacific coast of North America is home to a vibrant and diverse marine ecosystem, which is largely dependent on the presence of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, the sardine population is currently in a severe decline, which is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, and experts are urging the council to take action to protect the sardine population.\n\nThe PFMC should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of sardines is not only affecting the fishing industry, but also the marine mammals, seabirds, and other predators that rely on them for food.\n\nThe reason for the decline is unclear, but scientists believe that a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may be playing a role. The decline has been so severe that federal fishery managers have slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, and some environmental groups are calling for a halt to sardine fishing altogether.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with populations surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The species has a history of collapse, with the most recent decline beginning in 1999. However, the current decline is the steepest since the mid-20th century, and experts warn that if sardines do not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years.\n\nIn recent years, scientists have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of sardines as \"forage fish,\" and research has shown that some ocean predators are starving without them. The scarcity of prey is believed to be a leading factor behind the recent surge in malnourished sea lion pups washing up on beaches.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

The study found that while only 2% of the US population is currently vegetarian or vegan, another 10% have been vegetarian or vegan in the past but now consume meat. The study's findings suggest that lapses from a vegetarian or vegan diet are often due to social pressures, difficulty in addressing food cravings, and transitioning to the diet too quickly.\n\nThe study also found that current vegetarians and vegans have a wide range of motivations that keep them committed to their diet, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health.

The investigation began when a deputy in Michigan found multiple tubs of undelivered mail in a ravine in February 2017. Authorities dug up the frozen mail bundles and transported them to the La Porte Post Office, where they were matched to Block's assigned routes.\n\nBlock allegedly paid a friend $50 to burn the mail he didn't have time to deliver, and also hid 6,000 pieces of mail at his home. When questioned by police, Block initially denied any involvement, but later admitted to taking home mail he couldn't deliver and paying his friend to burn it. He also told investigators that he would unload the bundles on his lunch break and that this went on for months.\n\nBlock resigned from his job at the post office on February 7, 2017, and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.

The researchers noted that doctors often prescribe antibiotics due to pressure from patients or parents, and that better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, which pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that solar panels facing west instead of south produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm). This is because west-facing panels capture more solar energy in the late afternoon, when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, which is when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study also found that west-facing panels reduced peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are not only generating more electricity, but also reducing their reliance on the grid during peak hours.\n\nThe findings of the study have significant implications for the residential solar market. It suggests that homeowners with east-west roof pitches, who have historically been told they are not good candidates for solar, may actually be better off with west-facing panels. Additionally, the study's results could prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, which are currently not eligible for rebates unless they are facing south.\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, it is important to note that the results may vary depending on the region and the structure of the incentives provided by utility companies.

The research, published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences and Nature Communications, reveals that Ötzi suffered from severe gum disease, cavities, and worn-out teeth due to his diet of coarse grain and use of his teeth as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools.\n\nThe study used 3D computer tomography (CAT scan) to examine Ötzi's teeth, which showed signs of a fall or accident that led to the loss of one of his front teeth.

The findings suggest that the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth during the late Stone Age may have been caused by the uptick in starches in the diet.\n\nIn addition to the dental study, an international team has sequenced Ötzi's entire genome, revealing new insights into his genetic makeup. The analysis showed that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, despite having none of the current risk factors such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking.

The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, such as fruit bats.\n\n**Previous Outbreaks**\n\nMarburg has been linked to several outbreaks in the past, including a 1967 outbreak in Germany and Yugoslavia, and a 1998 outbreak in Uganda that infected 154 people and killed 128. Another large outbreak in Angola infected 252 people and killed 227 in 2004.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Marburg, but hospitalized patients can receive general supportive therapy. Experimental treatments are being developed, and Uganda has experience in controlling outbreaks of similar diseases.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nThe Ugandan government has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures, and the World Health Organization has been informed.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The gas giant is believed to be almost as big as Neptune and orbits the sun at a distance of billions of miles, taking 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete one orbit. The discovery was made by a team of researchers at Caltech, led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006.\n\nBrown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the planet's existence, and believe it will be detected via telescope within the next five years. The discovery has sparked renewed debate about Pluto's status as a planet, with some arguing that it should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown and other scientists argue that Pluto is not a planet, but rather a dwarf planet, and that the solar system is better understood with eight dominant objects, rather than nine.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also led to a re-evaluation of the definition of a planet, with some scientists suggesting that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) may need to revisit its criteria for what constitutes a planet. The IAU defines a planet as an object that orbits the sun, has sufficient mass to assume a hydrostatic equilibrium shape, and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Planet Nine meets the first two criteria, but not the third, as its orbit overlaps with that of other objects in the Kuiper Belt.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Pluto's status, Brown and other scientists are excited about the discovery of Planet Nine, which they believe will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The discovery has also sparked a renewed interest in the study of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies and other small celestial objects beyond the orbit of Neptune.\n\nIn related news, the New Horizons spacecraft, which flew by Pluto in 2015, has provided new insights into the dwarf planet's composition and geology. The mission has also sparked a renewed debate about Pluto's status as a planet, with some scientists arguing that it should be reinstated as a planet.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

This discrepancy has sparked a new wave of interest in the mysterious forces that make up 95 percent of the universe, including dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation.\n\nThe new findings are based on a study that used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The researchers used a technique called \"standard candles\" to calculate the distances, which involved measuring the brightness of stars called Cepheid variables and comparing it to their apparent brightness as seen from Earth.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the universe and its fate. If the expansion rate is indeed higher than previously thought, it could mean that the distance between galaxies will double in about 9.8 billion years. It could also suggest that Einstein's theory of relativity is incomplete or that there are unknown physical processes pushing space apart.\n\nThe study's lead author, Adam Riess, said that the discovery is an important clue to understanding the mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything. He noted that the speedier universe also raises the possibility that dark energy, which is a mysterious force that is driving the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be shoving galaxies away from each other more powerfully than originally estimated.\n\nThe discovery has sparked a new wave of research and debate among scientists, with some suggesting that the universe may be filled with unknown subatomic particles that travel nearly as fast as the speed of light. Others have proposed that the discrepancy could be due to an incomplete understanding of dark energy or dark matter.\n\nOverall, the discovery is a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the universe and its evolution, and it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos.", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number—and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo.

The film, based on Roald Dahl's beloved children's book, was expected to be a major hit, but its poor performance has left many wondering what went wrong. Despite receiving positive reviews from critics, the film's marketing campaign was criticized for being confusing and lacking a clear appeal to modern audiences.\n\nThe film's poor performance is attributed to several factors, including its high production budget of $140 million, the lack of recognizable stars, and the confusing title, which may not be familiar to many audiences. Additionally, the film's release date, which coincided with the success of \"Finding Dory\", may have also contributed to its poor performance.\n\nThe failure of \"The BFG\" is a rare misstep for Spielberg, who has a long history of successful films. However, it is not the first time he has faced a box office bomb, with his 1979 film \"1941\" being another notable example.\n\nDespite the poor performance of \"The BFG\", Spielberg remains one of the most successful filmmakers in Hollywood, with a long history of critically acclaimed and commercially successful films.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The review comes after The Washington Post reported that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people, but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.\n\nThe review has found that nearly every examiner in the FBI's microscopic hair comparison unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants.

The FBI's hair examiners performed more hair examinations for federal and state agencies than any other crime lab, and their testimony was often used to link defendants to crime scenes. However, the FBI now uses visual hair comparison to rule out someone as a possible source of hair or as a screening step before more accurate DNA testing.\n\nThe review is expected to continue for several months, and its findings could provide a way for defendants to make a retroactive challenge to old evidence using newer, more accurate scientific methods.

A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials.

Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower.

The practice was introduced by Joseph Smith, the church's founder, in the 1840s and was practiced by some members of the church for over 50 years. Plural marriage was seen as a commandment from God and was believed to be a way to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant. It was also seen as a way to create a sense of cohesion and group identification among church members.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without controversy, however. It was illegal in the United States and was widely rejected by society. Many church members, including Joseph Smith's wife Emma, opposed the practice. Joseph Smith himself was criticized for his involvement in plural marriage, and it is believed that he was killed in part because of his involvement in the practice.\n\nDespite the controversy, many church members continued to practice plural marriage, and it remained a part of the church's doctrine until 1890, when the church's president, Wilford Woodruff, issued a manifesto stating that the practice would no longer be allowed. The church has since officially disavowed plural marriage, and it is no longer practiced by members of the church.\n\nToday, the church teaches that marriage is a monogamous institution between one man and one woman, and that it is a sacred covenant between the couple and God. The church also teaches that families can be sealed together in temples, which allows them to be together in the afterlife. While the practice of plural marriage is no longer a part of the church's doctrine, it remains an important part of the church's history and is still studied and discussed by church members today.", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors.

The device, called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain.\n\nThe study, led by neuroscientist Niels Birbaumer, involved four patients with LIS, aged 24 to 76, who were trained to use the system more than a year after their diagnosis. The patients were asked to think \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France.\" The computer hooked up to the cap learned to distinguish the blood flow patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient.\n\nThe patients were able to score at least 70% on the training questions, allowing them to move on to more personal questions. The most important of these were about quality of life, and surprisingly, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with life. This suggests that LIS may not be the living hell many presume it to be.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Plos Biology, do not mean that all locked-in patients are content with their lives. However, they do suggest that patients with LIS may have a more positive outlook on life than previously thought.\n\nThe researchers are now working on building a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. They believe that a system that reads brain activity could achieve the same ends as the current device.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the treatment of patients with LIS and could potentially transform the lives of those who are too disabled to communicate. The researchers hope that their work will lead to a more accurate understanding of the experiences of patients with LIS and improve their quality of life.", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system. And it turns out that one of them really didn't want his daughter to marry her boyfriend. The patients all had advanced ALS and were unable to control even their eyes, reports the Guardian. In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 9424}

Recently, a genealogist claimed to have uncovered her true identity as Renee Goldberg, a Holocaust survivor who immigrated to the United States and grew up in the San Fernando Valley. Angelyne has denied this claim, stating that she will only reveal her true identity in her memoirs.\n\nAngelyne's rise to fame began in the early 1980s, when she started appearing on billboards and driving around the city in her pink Corvette. She has since become a cult figure in Hollywood, with many celebrities and artists paying homage to her. Despite her fame, Angelyne remains reclusive and has turned down numerous offers for reality TV shows and other projects. She has also been known to auction off rides in her car and sell merchandise out of her trunk.\n\nAngelyne's business model is built on her scarcity and mystery, with fans willing to pay top dollar for her image and appearances.

The woman who's adorned hundreds of billboards across LA since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym Angelyne—she's been called a precursor to other \"famous for being famous\" celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian—appears to have started off as Ronia Tamar Goldberg. She came to California in 1959 by way of Israel, and her mother died of cancer at the age of 44 when Goldberg, who upon arrival to LA became Renee, was just 14. Baum reached out to Goldberg's alleged younger sister, now Annette Block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all.

The mission was a culmination of years of hard work and dedication by thousands of people involved in the Apollo program.\n\n**The Challenges of Space Travel**\n\nOne of the biggest challenges faced by astronauts was the lack of a washroom facility on the spacecraft. The first astronauts, including Alan Shepard, had to use makeshift solutions, such as a garter belt with a condom, to relieve themselves during the flight. The external urine collection device became a staple of space missions, and the Gemini program introduced a poop containment system to deal with the challenges of long-duration spaceflight.\n\n**Life on the Moon**\n\nFor the crews who landed on the moon, using the washroom was both easier and harder. The one-sixth gravity made it easier to clean up, but the lack of a washroom facility meant that astronauts had to use diapers, which were not always effective. Charlie Duke, an astronaut on the Apollo 16 mission, had an accident when his urine containment system became unattached from his person.\n\n**Advances in Washroom Technology**\n\nLonger term missions lasting months on the International Space Station have yielded advances in washroom technology, and the shift to mixed-gender crews has made moderate privacy a necessity.

Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The plan is estimated to cost nearly $1.4 trillion annually, to be funded through a combination of taxes, including a new 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers, and tax hikes on the wealthy.\n\nThe bill has been praised by progressive activists and some Democratic officeholders, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker, who have cosponsored the bill. However, the plan is unlikely to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress, and some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have not publicly endorsed the bill.\n\nDespite the challenges, single-payer health care is gaining popularity among the public, with 53% of Americans supporting a national health care plan, according to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance.

Cordell claimed that he and Carlson had committed the murders, and that Brunke was not involved.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21.

Monson—who was ordained as a bishop at the age of 22 and became one of the church's apostles at 36—had led the church for almost a decade and largely remained behind the scenes during a tumultuous 10 years for the church, though he was well-known for helping the needy and often turned up unannounced at funerals or at the bedsides of the ill, reports the Salt Lake Tribune, which describes him as an \"affable leader\" and a \"folksy preacher.\" Monson, who was born in Salt Lake City and served in the Navy during World War II, was president of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for 13 years before becoming church leader. The AP reports that he's likely to be remembered for his humanitarian work, for lowering the minimum age for missionaries to 18 for men and 19 for women—and for leading his church's support of California's same-sex marriage ban in 2008. The Deseret News notes that Monson also, as chairman of the Missionary Executive Committee, assigned the first black Mormon missionary. No successor has been named yet, but under church protocol, the next president will be 93-year-old Russell Nelson, who is now the longest-serving member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8480}

The study, which analyzed data from 15,000 twins, found that sons of older fathers scored higher on the \"Geek Index\", which measures non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness. The researchers also found that the mother's age had no impact on the results, and daughters seemed to be immune to the trend.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that older fathers may be passing on geeky traits to their sons, which could be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The researchers believe that the trend for delayed parenthood may lead to a \"society of geniuses\" that can help solve the world's problems.\n\nHowever, the study also highlights the risks associated with older fatherhood, including an increased risk of infertility, miscarriage, and conceiving a child with a variety of debilitating disorders. The researchers believe that some genetic traits inherited from older fathers could be affecting both geekiness and autism.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Magdalena Janecka, emphasized that the findings should not influence individual families' decisions on parenthood, and that the dangers of older parenting should not be overlooked. The study's results have sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that the benefits of older fatherhood outweigh the risks, while others caution against the potential risks associated with older sperm.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between paternal age and offspring traits, and highlights the need for further research into the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to geekiness and autism.", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}

The report also found that the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio has been increasing steadily over the years, with CEOs earning 312 times more than their workers on average.\n\nThe report attributes the growth in CEO compensation to the rise in stock-related components of compensation, such as stock awards and stock options realized. It also notes that the growth in CEO compensation has been driven by the stock market, with CEOs cashing in on rising stock prices.\n\nThe report concludes that the escalation of CEO compensation has fueled the growth of top 1 percent incomes and has contributed to income inequality. It suggests that policy options, such as higher marginal income tax rates and changes in corporate governance, could help reverse the trend of excessive executive pay and broaden wage growth.\n\nThe news also highlights the lack of transparency in CEO compensation, with many companies not disclosing the ratio of CEO-to-worker compensation.
