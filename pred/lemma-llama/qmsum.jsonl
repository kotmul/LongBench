They have found that parents are more likely to take up the offer if they are informed about it and understand how it works. This suggests that a national roll-out will need to focus on effective communication and outreach.\n\n3. The early implementers have identified challenges around staff shortages and capacity. They have had to work with existing staff and resources to deliver the scheme, which has put pressure on their existing provision.
